This extension provides a QR code to scan with your Radix Wallet, which setting up a connection between your Radix Wallet and your desktop browser.\n\nThe connection is fully end-to-end encrypted and is also peer-to-peer, meaning there will be no centralized server holding your data or sending your messages back and forth.\n\nOn mobile, the process is even easier. dApps in your mobile browser can directly connect to your Radix Wallet app running on the same phone.\n\nLearn: [What is Radix Connect](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/what-is-radix-connect)",

The size of network fees reflect the burden each transaction puts on the network.\n\n**Royalties**: These are set by developers who deploy code or run applications on the network. Royalties allow developers to collect a “use fee” every time their work is used as part of a transaction.\n\n**Tips**: These are optional payments users can make directly to validators to prioritize their own transactions during periods of high network demand.\n\nLearn: [More about transaction fees](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/how-do-transaction-fees-work-on-radix)",
	"infoLink_glossary_behaviors": "## Asset Behaviors\n\nAsset behaviors define the rules that were placed on a [token](?glossaryAnchor=tokens) or [NFT](?glossaryAnchor=nfts) when it was created. They ensure all users know exactly what actions can be performed on any asset. And they’re labeled in everyday language so everyone can read them, understand them and know the nature of the asset they’re holding.\n\n---\n\nThe [Radix Network](?glossaryAnchor=radixnetwork) is built differently to all other blockchains. One of the great benefits of this is that assets – tokens and NFTs – are native to the ecosystem. So unlike on networks such as Ethereum, where tokens are not really tokens but just balances on a smart contract, assets on Radix act like real-life assets. With real-life assets of different kinds, you know who can create it, destory it, take it away from you or freeze it within your bank account. Similarly with Radix, you’ll always know how assets will behave and what someone can do to them.\n\nWhen anyone creates a token or NFT on Radix, there is a list of behaviors they can apply to them. Things like being able to increase the token’s supply, being able to change an NFT’s image and description, or being able to remove a token from someone’s account. There are plenty of valid reasons for why someone might want to do these things, but it’s always good to know if they can.\n\nJust tap into any token in the Radix Wallet to get a full list of its behaviors.",

The amount of LSU represents the quantity of XRD stake to that validator, which will increase as new emissions are provided.\n\nBecause they're liquid, LSUs can be traded within the Radix Network like any other asset. The holder of the LSU can also redeem the XRD that they represent.\n\nTo request an unstake of XRD tokens, the user does a special transaction to send some LSU back to the validator component, which returns a [stake claim NFT](?glossaryAnchor=claimnfts) that can later be redeemed for the XRD after an unstaking delay.\n\nLearn: [How to Stake and Unstake XRD](https://learn.radixdlt.com/article/how-to-stake-and-unstake-xrd)",

Here’s a webpage, look at it, click it. That was Web1.\n\n**Web2** made it possible for users to create their own content online. Social media, social news, photo sharing, and more became possible – communicating on the web became a 2-way street\n\nHowever, parts of the web are still a 1-way street. While we have control of what we create and share, we don’t have control over _what we own_ and _who we are_. Your money and everything you can do with it is still locked inside separate bank or payment apps, and your logins are specific to every website (if not controlled by Google or Apple or Meta).\n\n**Web3** now adds the ability for users to own their own digital assets and digital identities online, and allows websites and other applications to interact with these truly digital-native assets and identities in powerful new ways.\n\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were the very beginning of web3, but it goes so much further. In web3, “Decentralized Finance” becomes possible, making finance cheaper, better, and more accessible to anyone – financial services compete to put your money to work, rather than charging you for the privilege of holding it. And new things become possible; imagine logging out of your favorite game, but taking your equipment with you to trade with others directly, outside the game?\n\nThis new capability is generally enabled by blockchain technology, but it is in its early days.
